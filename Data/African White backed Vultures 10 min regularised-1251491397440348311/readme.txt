This annotated animal movement dataset comes from the Env-DATA Track Annotation Service on Movebank (movebank.org). The environmental data attributes are created and distributed by government and research organizations. For general information on the Env-DATA System, see Dodge et al. (2013) and https://www.movebank.org/node/6607.

Terms of Use: Verify the terms of use for relevant tracking data and environmental datasets prior to presenting or publishing these data. Terms of use for animal movement data in Movebank are defined by the study owners in the License Terms for the study. Terms of use for environmental datasets vary by provider; see below for details.

File attributes

Attributes from the Movebank database (see the Movebank Attribute Dictionary at http://www.movebank.org/node/2381):
Location Lat: latitude in decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
Location Long: longitude in decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
Timestamp: the time of the animal location estimates, in UTC

Locations are the the geographic coordinates of locations along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data.

Attributes from annotated environmental data:
Name: MODIS Land Terra Vegetation Indices 500m 16d NDVI
Description: The normalized difference vegetation index: a measure of the concentration of live plant leaves based on remote sensing reflectance measurements. Higher values indicate more vegetation. Estimate is based on the highest quality image obtained during each 16-day period.
Unit: unitless (NDVI)
No data values: -3 (provider), NaN (interpolated)
Interpolation: inverse-distance-weighted
